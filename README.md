# Ruby on Rails Tutorial sample application

The production version of this application is located [here](https://rortutorialapp.herokuapp.com/).
 
Most of the code is the same as Michael Hartl's, but there are some instances where I've gone ahead of the tutorial and implemented a feature differently. Also: more comments.

## Getting started

To get started with the app, clone the repo and then install the needed gems:

```
$ bundle install --without production
```

Next, migrate the database:

```
$ rails db:migrate
```

Finally, run the test suite to verify that everything is working correctly:

```
$ rails test
```

If the test suite passes, you'll be ready to run the app in a local server:

```
$ rails server
```
